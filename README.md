# umd-tron
UMD project for Tron.

Use Solidity 0.4.25 to Compile this project. 

At the initial stage of the project, there is a maintenance account named TYt5HBTyyfvDn6HT3wHWw8fNfZjaX5v5Am, which is used to effectively adjust the contract operation according to the actual operation conditions in the trial operation stage.
At present, the trial operation stage has been completed, the maintenance account has been self closed, and all contracts will be properly operated according to the ad hoc rules.
